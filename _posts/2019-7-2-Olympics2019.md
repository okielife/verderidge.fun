description: The 2019 Neighborhood Olympics were a huge neighborhood event that allowed
  kids to participate in 18 events across 4 sports. I kept all of the top scores,
  because those people now hold the Olympic Record. We also donated 50$ to Save the
  Children Charity. These Olympic Games are the first in Verde Ridge history.
