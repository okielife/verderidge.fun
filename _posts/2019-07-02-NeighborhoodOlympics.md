<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">50 yard dash</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">40 foot swimming</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">More</li>
</ul>

Several interesting things happened.

Some families attended.

Since this was the first Olympics in the neighborhood, all winning times and distances were new records.
