  <p>Sunday, July 6,8 - The 2021 Neighborhood Olympics</p>
  <p>The Olympics were an idea that I had 2 years ago, but i finally had the opportunity to do it again.
     The fun sports include Athletics, Swimming, Cycling, Archery, and Basketball, with a total of 30 events in 6 sports.
     Last time, we donated a lot of money to charity, so we hope to do the same this year. So, mark your calendars
     for June 05-06, and have some fun with us! *IMPORTANT* Each Olympian costs $5 to enter, everything goes straight
     to the Save the Children charity, also, we decided it was probably best to postpone the Olympics, because of so many
     reasons we just couldn't avoid. We are hopeful the same doesn't happen this coming time.</p>
  <p>Update as of June 30:
  We had a small issue(the rain) that we could not get around.
  I have decided to make the whole Olympics 2 separate days, on Tuesday, July 6, and Thursday, July 8. We are very sorry for inconveniences about the schedule.</p>
