  <p>June 05-06 - The 2021 Neighborhood Olympics</p>
  <p>The Olympics were an idea that I had 2 years ago, but i finally had the opportunity to do it again.
     The fun sports include Athletics, Swimming, Cycling, Archery, and Basketball, with a total of 30 events in 6 sports.
     Last time, we donated a lot of money to charity, so we hope to do the same this year. So, mark your calendars
     for June 05-06, and have some fun with us! *IMPORTANT* Each Olympian costs $5 to enter, everything goes straight
     to the Save the Children charity, also, backup date on June 26-27.</p>
