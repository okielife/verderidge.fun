# verderidge.fun
Verde Ridge is the neighborhood that we live in, and we decided to make a website about/on it.
We created the Verde Ridge Olympics 2 years ago, and we thought we could build on it.
And so, the Django-based website was born, with only a few options and buttons, but that grew into this.
We plan to keep working on it for a while, and I personally love doing it! It is so fun!
