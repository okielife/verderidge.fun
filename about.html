            <p>Hello! We live in Verde Ridge, and we absolutely love to put on fun neighborhood activities.
            As you know, we are planning to put on the Olympics this year, but you guys can do stuff too!
            If you have an activity that you would like to share, just send us the details, and it'll be on the website!</p>
            <h5>A HUGE thanks to these people here!</h5>
