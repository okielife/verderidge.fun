            <p>Hello! We live in Verde Ridge, and we absolutely love to put on fun neighborhood activities.
            As you know, we are planning to put on the Olympics this year, but you guys can do stuff too!
            We are welcoming you to put on your own activites, and we will put them on the website!</p>
            <p><b>This website was developed by Gibson Lee, host of the Olympics, my family, for helping me learn coding
                and helping me put up the event, and you guys, for the motivation to do this!</b></p>
